This project analyzes global layoff trends (2020â€“2023) using SQL and the `layoffs.csv` dataset, which includes company, industry, location, and layoff data. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory queries, and insights into layoff patterns by year, industry, country, and company stage. Key findings reveal 2022 as the peak year, with tech and post-IPO companies most affected. SQL techniques such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and aggregation were used to transform and analyze the data efficiently. This project offers a clear, structured view of workforce trends during recent global economic shifts, helping understand sector-specific employment impacts.
